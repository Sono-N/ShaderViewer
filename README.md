# tryShaders
Learning and Testing Shader  programming on  browser

## Description
It is a simple shader viewer currently under development.
Once I wanted to write a shader in WebGL, but it was not easy to generate even a single polygon until I got used to it, and it was difficult to feel free to write transparent shaders, toon shaders, etc.
So I aimed to create a web site that could be used for beginners who just started learning like me.

## Function
* UI to change uniform variables
* GLSL editable editor
* Different types of Shader prepared in advance
